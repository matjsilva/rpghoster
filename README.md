## Why did i started to create RPGHoster?

  It's simple: i always loved tabletop RPGs, but honestly, all that rules and math were starting to get extremely confusing, so i've decided to create a virtual environment where you can play a tabletop RPG with your friends without getting stressed with non-sense rules.
